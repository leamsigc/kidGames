# How to take notes in vscode

Published on: 2022-07-01

 In this small tutorial i wil show you how i take notes in my vscode editor, is really handy and important when you start your day that you take notes or make a small todo list of all the stuff that need to be done by the end of the day


## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next
